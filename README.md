# Bussiness Understanding

Selecting the right aircraft to start a business is a crucial decision, as choosing an aircraft with a high risk profile can result in operational disruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage. Therefore, it is essential to which aircraft are likely to pose the lowest risk for purchase.

in this analysis we will be looking at previous aricrafts accidents to be able to make reccomandations on which aircrafts carry the  lowest risk

# Data Understaning
The Data that was used for this analysis will be pulled from one file 
* **Source**: This dataset can be found in [`kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses/data) which is a platform with thousands of datasets from all sorts of topics 
* **Contents**: The Data conatins various columns of diffrent information about the aircrafts involved in the accident and the locations involved 
* **Format**: The data is stored in a csv file (comma separated value )

# conclusion
1. The Aircrafts that are made by Cessna have been involved in the most number of accidents and has the most number of injured people compared to other makes 
2. The Aircrafts that are made by Boeing have been involved least number of accidents and has the most number of uninsured people
3. The Aircrafts of model 152 have been involved in the most number  of accident and have the most number of injuries 
4. The Aircrafts of model DC-10-10 have the least number of injuries 
5. Aircrafts that have more than one engine are less likely to get into an accident and also have less injured people during accidents

# Recommendations

1. **Model-** 
2. **Make -** 
3. **Engines -**
